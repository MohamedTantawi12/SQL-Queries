Question 1
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. 
The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

SELECT ff.title, c.name, count(*) rental_count
FROM Category c
JOIN Film_Category f
on c.category_id = f.category_id
JOIN Inventory i
on i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN Rental r
on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN Film ff
on ff.film_id = f.film_id
WHERE c.name in ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family ', 'Music')
GROUP by 1,2
ORDER by 2

Question 4:
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. 
Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for 
that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

SELECT strftime('%m', r.rental_date) Rental_mounth, strftime('%Y', r.rental_date) Rental_year, ss.store_id Store_Id, count(*) Count_rentals
FROM rental r
JOIN staff s
on s.staff_id = r.staff_id
JOIN store ss
on ss.store_id = s.staff_id
GROUP by 1, 2, 3
ORDER by 4 DESC

Question 5
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, 
and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, 
and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

with t1 as
(SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, sum(p.amount) pay_amount
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
on p.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP by  1, 2
ORDER by 3 DESC
LIMIT 10)

SELECT strftime('%Y %m', p.payment_date) pay_mon, c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name as fullname, count(*) pay_counpermon, sum(p.amount) pay_amount
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
on p.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN t1
where t1.first_name = c.first_name and t1.last_name = c.last_name
GROUP by 1, 2
ORDER by 2

Question 6

Finally, for each of these top 10 paying customers, I would like to find out the difference across their monthly payments during 2007. 
Please go ahead and write a query to compare the payment amounts in each successive month. 
Repeat this for each of these 10 paying customers. Also, it will be tremendously helpful if you can identify the customer name who paid 
the most difference in terms of payments.

with t1 as
(SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, sum(p.amount) pay_amount
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
on p.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP by  1, 2
ORDER by 3 DESC
LIMIT 10),

t2 as
(SELECT strftime('%Y %m', p.payment_date) pay_mon, c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name as fullname, count(*) pay_counpermon, 
sum(p.amount) pay_amount,
sum(p.amount) - lag(sum(p.amount)) OVER (PARTITION BY c.first_name ORDER BY strftime('%m', p.payment_date)) diff
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
on p.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN t1
where t1.first_name = c.first_name and t1.last_name = c.last_name
GROUP by 1, 2
ORDER by 2)


SELECT fullname, max(diff) max_diff
FROM t2
